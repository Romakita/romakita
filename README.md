Hi, I'm Romain! An open source developer :D

I'm the author of the Ts.ED framework. I started open source in 2016 and, since then I have invested a lot of time in it to build tools that other developers can use. It's also an extraordinary source of knowledge and sharing which has greatly contributed to my personal and professional development.
And I never get tired of it!

My goals are to keep my works on the framework and his ecosystem and contribute as many as is possible for other Open Source projects!

You can help me to achieve my goals of improving the world through code, help me create better developer experiences, or just say "thank you" by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Romakita) on GitHub. Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated.

**About me**
